- fix undo battle royale (should be possible with new move system so multiple changes can be done)
- Implement visual queue for disapearing squares -> Mines etc.
- REMOVE CLONING! do everything with undo
	- more memory efficient
	- easier to implement, no custom clone functions needed!
	- fixes castling bug with MoveCount

- move history go forward
- null piece so no more piece != null checks, store no null pieces though
- fix flipping im to down rn sowwy :(
- setup custom positions ingame

IDEAS for chess variants, Board can be a specific game mode.
- En passant
- 6th rank pawn sack for deleting square from board.
- 2 kings
- connected lacer rooks
- round board
- multiple moves per turn

Speed Up/ Better AI Ideas:
- Transposition Table, store past evaluations
- extends the best x moves to see which of those is better with a bit more depth, just searches the result path -1 depth
- don't use recursion so you can search layer by layer.
(- dont start multiple recursions but rather use threads in ONE recursion. Better Alpha-Beta-Pruning.)

Dead speed up ideas: 
?? change MinMax to make moves and undo in same board (memory efficiency!) does not work

line count: 
git ls-files | grep '\.cs' | xargs wc -l
