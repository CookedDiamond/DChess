? En passant
? Castling
- add is check and isCapture to Move
- use isCheck and isCapture in MinMax to sort moves. (think about other criteria to sort. best move should be first)

- find solution so battle royale can be undone (should be possible with new move system so multiple changes can be done)
- Ideas for chess variants, Board can be a specific game mode.
	- 6th rank pawn sack for deleting square from board.
	! 2 kings
	- connected lacer rooks
	- round board
(- Menu)
	? Settings
(- Settings in textfile (json))
(- Overlay)
(- Time controll)
- InputHandler
(- inform about write in network stream with different threads)
? use async read and other async methods instead of while(true) with threads
	- close the 'while true threads' with windows "x"
! null piece so no more piece != null checks
- generalisation of promoting on the last square!
? Implement visual queue for disapearing squares -> Mines etc.
- fix flipping im to down rn sowwy :(
- load position from input file
- (LONG) play automatically vs different bot versions.
- fix online

Dead speed up ideas: 
?? change MinMax to make moves and undo in same board (memory efficiency!) does not work
