IDEAS for chess variants, Board can be a specific game mode.
- 6th rank pawn sack for deleting square from board.
- 2 kings
- connected lacer rooks
- round board

Speed Up/ Better AI Ideas:
- extends the best 3 moves to see which of those is better with a bit more depth, just searches the result path -1 depth
- dont start multiple recursions but rather use threads in ONE recursion. Better Alpha-Beta-Pruning.

Dead speed up ideas: 
?? change MinMax to make moves and undo in same board (memory efficiency!) does not work

line count: 
git ls-files | grep '\.cs' | xargs wc -l
