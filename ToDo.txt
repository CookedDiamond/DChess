! remove networking from board
- inform about write in network stream with different threads
? use async read and other async methods instead of while(true) with threads
	- close the 'while true threads' with windows "x"
! null piece so no more piece != null checks
- better eval function (should work with all field sizes)
- some parts of eval into pieces
! Change board less with battle royale so bots can see with depth 4
? Implement visual queue for disapearing squares -> Mines etc.
