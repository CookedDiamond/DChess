? En passant
? Castling
- Ideas for chess variants, Board can be a specific game mode.
	- 6th rank pawn sack for deleting square from board.
	! Battle royal -> chess board gets smaller (if no piece is in a row/ colum it gets deleted soon)
	- 2 kings
	- connected lacer rooks
	- round board
- Menu
	- Start Game
? Settings
- Settings in textfile (json)
(- Overlay)
(- Time controll)
- InputHandler
(- Think about better gamescaling architecture)
- Text Button 
	- center text in button
- remove networking from board
- inform about write in network stream with different threads
? use async read and other async methods instead of while(true) with threads
	- close the 'while true threads' with windows "x"
! null piece so no more piece != null checks
- better eval function (should work with all field sizes)
- some parts of eval into pieces
- fix variants/ cloning of board
